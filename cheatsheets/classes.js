/* extends
JavaScript classes support the concept of inheritance â€” a child class can extend a parent class. 
This is accomplished by using the extends keyword as part of the class definition.
Child classes have access to all of the instance properties and methods of the parent class. 
They can add their own properties and methods in addition to those. 
A child class constructor calls the parent class constructor using the super() method.

// Parent class
class Media {
  constructor(info) {
    this.publishDate = info.publishDate
    this.name = info.name
  }
}

// Child class
class Song extends Media {
  constructor(songData) {
    super(songData)
    this.artist = songData.artist
  }

const mySong = new Song({
  artist: 'Queen',
